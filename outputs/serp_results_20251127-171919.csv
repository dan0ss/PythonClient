Popular spots

- **Sandy Bay:** Located about 80 kilometers from Exmouth, this beach is known for its excellent fishing opportunities and requires a self-drive vehicle.
- **Cape Range National Park:** Fishing is popular along the lagoon on the western side of Exmouth, accessible by road.
- **Exmouth Gulf:** The shallower, reefy areas within the gulf offer good fishing opportunities.

Techniques and what to use

- **Beach casting:** A good option from many of the accessible beaches.
- **Stick baiting and popper fishing:** Popular techniques for surface strikes, especially around dawn and dusk.
- **Bait fishing:** Use fresh baits like squid and mullet, which are also effective for certain species.
- **Lure fishing:** Soft plastics and other lures can be very effective on the reefy areas.

- The pink color comes from a type of algae, [Dunaliella salina](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6036db4e80af994f&hl=en&gl=AU&q=Dunaliella+salina&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijt6uX65KRAxV6UaQEHcrPAuQQxccNegUI6wEQAQ), which thrives in the extremely salty water of the lakes.

- The pink color comes from a type of algae, [Dunaliella salina](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6036db4e80af994f&hl=en&gl=AU&q=Dunaliella+salina&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijt6uX65KRAxV6UaQEHcrPAuQQxccNegUI6wEQAQ), which thrives in the extremely salty water of the lakes.

What gives the lakes their pink color?

- The pink color comes from a type of algae, [Dunaliella salina](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6036db4e80af994f&hl=en&gl=AU&q=Dunaliella+salina&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijt6uX65KRAxV6UaQEHcrPAuQQxccNegUI6wEQAQ), which thrives in the extremely salty water of the lakes.
- The algae produce pink and red carotenoids to protect their chlorophyll from sunlight, giving the water its distinct color.[[1]](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/news/2022/04/20/23/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-victorias-pink-lakes#:~:text=Thursday%2021%20April%2C%202022,the%20lake%20its%20pink%20colour.%22)[[2]](https://www.kalbarri.org.au/explore/pink-lake-hutt-lagoon)"
